MODULE HOOKS (polymorphic functions or whatever they are)

There are a number of functions that are called automatically if they exist.

node_load(nid, vid)
    This function is implemented in node modules that want to add or modify a node.
    See the link module for example.  The returned storage object gets appended
    to the specific node.  This data gets cached automatically.
    
node_prepare(node):
    This function gets called after node_load and is where you should apply 
    any text filtering or other additions to add to the node.  

drupy_cron()
    A cron() function can be put in any module that needs stuff done periodically.
    
drupy_filter(text):
    Any module with this function defined can be used as input filter for
    text used in drupy.
    
form_add_node():
    

NODE MODULES

    A node module is any module that implements a node type.
    The name of the module must be the same as the node type.
    A node module must have the attribute drupy_node_module.
    

MODULE CONVENTIONS

Functions named 'listing_whatever' are probably going to require pagination.  
Because inc.pager.query() returns a tuple of (iter, pager_object) it is 
convention to also return a similarly formatted (sequence, pager_object) from 'listing_whatever'.  See node module for example.
