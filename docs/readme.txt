This project has next to zero documentation, and no unit testing.  
I make no claims to it's functionality.
Basically, I'm a terrible programmer.   

I am putting this online, only to establish that the project exists.
It's far from being usable, presentable, or at all worthy of anything.

Majority of this was created in July and August of 2007 when I had a 
lot of free time.  I've only started looking at the project again now 
during my spare time, in May 2008.

The project was at first called Drupy -- since my goal was to simply 
rewrite my entire Drupal powered site in Python.  I registered 
Drupy.org.  In April I received an email from Brendan Crawford.  
He has set out to do a direct line by line port of Drupal and started 
using the name Drupy.  Since I in no way intend to maintain a port of 
Drupal this project has been renamed Kulu -- the Hawaiian word for a 
drop.  Find out more about Drupy at Drupy.net and Drupal at Drupal.org.

The goal for this project is to develop the core functionality of 
Drupal with the simplicity of using Python.  The language choice 
should make performance better and module development simpler.  If 
Python can be used to simplify something or make it faster, it will be.

Webpy is used to simplify a lot of things.  See webpy.org.

Okay.
