Description:
------------
This is the SpreadFireFox theme. 

Authors:
--------
It was designed by Chris Messina (a.k.a. FactoryJoe) for the SpreadFireFox.com
web site.
It was ported from 4.4 to 4.5 and 4.6 by Khalid Baheyeldin http://baheyeldin.com/khalid.

Known Issues:
-------------
If you encounter blank space (white space) between elements, then you are seeing
a known problem with this theme. A workaround for this is to remove or comment
out all the lines that have "clear: " in them in the misc/drupal.css file. This
improves things a bit, but may cause some issues with certain elements.
